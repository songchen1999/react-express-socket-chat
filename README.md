# react-express-socket-chat
a real-time chat app made with react.js as client, express.js as server and socket.io.

Socket.io client fires events from client to sociket.io server, server listens for the events, and processes the events, and fires back a event, while the client is also listening for events from the server.

Users can join groups with a unique username, and send messages to members of the groups, and like membersâ€™ messages by clicking messages.
