# react-express-socket-chat
a real-time chat app made with react.js as client, express.js as server and socket.io.
deployed link: https://www.chat.songchen.space

Socket.io client fires events from client to sociket.io server, server listens for the events, and processes the events, and fires back a event, while the client is also listening for events from the server.

Users can join groups with a unique username, and send messages to members of the groups, and like membersâ€™ messages by clicking messages.
